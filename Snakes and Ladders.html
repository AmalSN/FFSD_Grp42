        <h2>How to Play Snakes and Ladders</h2>
        <p>
            The game Snakes and Ladders has enthralled generations of children, and gone through a few name changes
            along the way. Sometimes sold as Chutes and Ladders in the United States, and originally Snakes and Arrows
            in India, the game has barely changed in all this time. If you've lost the rules or you've made your own
            Snakes and Ladders board, you may want to review the rules before you play or perhaps try a variation on the
            traditional rules.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h2>The Equipment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Snakes and Ladders board</li>
            <li>1 die</li>
            <li>Playing pieces</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <h2>Setup</h2>
            Before the game can start each player will roll one die, the player who throws the highest number will be the one to have the first turn.
        </p>

        <p>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        The players will move their pieces from left to right, starting at 1, following the numbers on the board, then the next row from right to left and repeat. If a player rolls a 4, then the player would move their piece four places.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h2>Snakes</h2>
        When a player lands on a top of a snake, their playing piece will slide down to the bottom of the snake. <br>
        Whereas landing on the bottom of a snake the player will remain in the same spot until their next turn.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h2>Ladders</h2>
        When a player lands at the base of a ladder, it immediately climbs to the top of the ladder. <br>
        Whereas landing at the top of a ladder the player will stay there until the next turn. The player does not move to the bottom of the ladder.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
        The first player that reaches the highest space on the board, 100, wins the game. To win the player will need to roll the exact number to get you to the last space. If the player rolls a higher number than needed to land exactly on 100, their piece does not move and remains there until their next turn, when they can roll again.
        </p>

        <p>
            <h2>The Bounce Back Variation</h2>
            The first player that reaches the highest space on the board, 100, wins the game. To win the player will need to roll the exact number to get to the last space. If the roll is too high, the player's piece will bounce off the last space and move back. For example, if a player had four spaces to get to 100 and rolled a 6, the piece will move four spaces to 100, then â€œbounce back" two spaces to 98.
