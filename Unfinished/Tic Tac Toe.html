        <h2>How to Play Tic Tac Toe</h2>
        <p>
            Tic-tac-toe is a fun game that you can play any time and anywhere as long as you have a piece of paper, a
            pencil, and an opponent. Tic-tac-toe is a zero sum game, which means that if both players are playing their
            best, then neither player will win. However, if you learn how to play tic-tac-toe and master some simple
            strategies, then you'll be able to not only play, but to win the majority of the time.

        <h2>RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE</h2>

        <ol>
        <li>The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. </li>
        <li>You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. </li>
        <li>The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. </li>
        <li>When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a
        tie. </li>
    </ol>

        <h2>HOW CAN I WIN AT TIC-TAC-TOE?</h2>
        To beat the computer (or at least tie), you need to make use of a little bit of strategy. Strategy means
        figuring out what you need to do to win.

        Part of your strategy is trying to figure out how to get three Xs in a row. The other part is trying to figure
        out how to stop the computer from getting three Os in a row.

        After you put an X in a square, you start looking ahead. Where's the best place for your next X? You look at the
        empty squares and decide which ones are good choicesâ€”which ones might let you make three Xs in a row.

        You also have to watch where the computer puts its O. That could change what you do next. If the computer gets
        two Os in a row, you have to put your next X in the last empty square in that row, or the computer will win. You
        are forced to play in a particular square or lose the game.

        If you always pay attention and look ahead, you'll never lose a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You may not win, but at
        least you'll tie.
