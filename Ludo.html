        <h2>How to Play Ludo</h2>
        <p>
            Ludo is a fun, family-friendly board game for 2 to 4 people. The game has its roots in an Indian game called
            Pachisi, and it is similar to games like Parchisi (aka Parcheesi) and Uckers. It's easy to learn how to play
            Ludo! The goal of the game is to get all your pawns inside the home space, which is located in the middle of
            the board.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h2>The Equipment</h2>
        Ludo consists of a square board with four different colored bases in each corner. The first colored space
        outside of each base is the start position. A path leads clockwise around the board returning to a path with the
        same color as the base, then to the home column, which leads to the center home triangle. 
        <br>
        There are four different colored sets of playing pieces that start off in their matching bases. Each set
        consists of 4 playing pieces. The included die is used to govern the movement of the pieces.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        2 to 4 players begin by placing their respective pieces in their bases. Each takes turns throwing the die, and the player with the highest roll plays first. The players to the left follow in turn going clockwise. On each player’s turn, the player rolls the die to determine a move. The goal of the game is to move all four of the player’s pieces clockwise once around the board, up the home column, and into the home triangle.
        </p>
<p>
    <h2>Movement</h2>
    To begin, a player must roll a six to move a piece out of the base and onto the start position. That piece is then in play. The player cannot make any other moves until at least one piece is in play. <br><br>

If a player has a piece or pieces in play, they can move any one of their pieces 1 to 6 spaces along the path according to the number they roll.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>Rules of the 6’s.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If a six is rolled, the player can choose to either move a piece out of his base onto the start position or move a piece that is in play.</li>
        <li>Anytime a six is rolled, the player gets an extra roll after his move.</li>
        <li>If a six is rolled three times in a row, the player loses his turn.</li>
      </ul>
</p>

<p>
    <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
    When a player’s piece has reached the home column of its own color, the piece continues its moves toward the center to its home triangle. When a player’s die roll lands its piece on the home triangle, that piece has completed its journey. A piece can only be moved to the home triangle with an exact roll. <br>

The first player to have all four of his pieces finish their journeys wins. The remaining players continue the game to determine the runner-ups.
